In numerical linear algebra, the tridiagonal matrix algorithm, also known as the Thomas algorithm (named after Llewellyn Thomas),
is a simplified form of Gaussian elimination that can be used to solve tridiagonal systems of equations. 
A tridiagonal system for n unknowns may be written as ::


A[i] * X[i-1] + B[i] * X[i] + C[i] * X[i+1] = D[i]

where A[1] = 0 and C[n] = 0 

|b1 c1            |  | X[1] |     | d1 |
|a2 b2 c2	      |  | X[2] |     | d2 |
|   a3 b3  .      |  | X[3] |     | d3 |
|    .. ..        |  | ...  |  =  | .. |
|      .. ..      |  | ...  |     | .. |
|	       .. cn-1|  | ...  |     | .. |
|0         an   bn|  | X[n] |     | dn |


For such systems, the solution can be obtained in O(n) operations instead of O(n^3) required by Gaussian elimination.
A first sweep eliminates the a_i's, and then an (abbreviated) backward substitution produces the solution. Examples of such matrices commonly arise from the discretization of 1D Poisson equation (e.g., the 1D diffusion problem) and natural cubic spline interpolation.
